"FDA Trends & Global Regulation Insights***
    
    
    It's an honor to be presenting the first meeting for CAMDA and I wish all the success.
    
    and the regulatory space.
    
    For all of you who have been working in this space and know that it was revolutionized, basically. It went through the things that happened in the last five years. It reshaped the landscape for the regulations to be developed.
    
    I hope to discuss with you in brief the major players or forces that led to this revolution in the regulatory space for in vitro diagnostics and to discuss
    
    future opportunities.

    My talk will be structured in a way that's to help us. First, we'll sort of take an executive summary to go over. We will set the stage for today's presentation and then we will dive into the regulatory landscape in this period from 2020 to 2025.
    
    on the LDT regulatory oversight and the oversight shift, discuss changes in the technologies and how it impacted the regulatory landscape, and also the evolution of the IVD market. The impact of global markets and global regulations and talk about the CDRH strategic direction.
    
    And it impacts on different stakeholders, after which we are going to finally close with some emerging trends and takeaways for different stakeholders.
    
    ![page_003_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_003_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    So in the past five years, like we said, there was like a huge change. And I would say there are some major forces. Today I will discuss these four. Starting with the COVID-19 emergency use and emergency response, the digital evolution and technology evolution.
    
    The LDT regulatory oversight shifts the impact of global markets, which collectively led to this period, which is characterised by the rapid innovation and growth of global markets. and unprecedented regulatory adaptation and flexibility demonstrated by the FDA, particularly in response to the COVID.
    
    ![page_004_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_004_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    I will start by just sharing the numbers, because truly the numbers in this case, they tell the story. There is a record-breaking EUA submissions between March 2020 to May 2023. The number of EUA submissions was more than all EUA submissions from all previous emergencies combined.
    
    So, this in and of itself is something to be appreciated. And this is one of the biggest forces that Because changes, which I believe some of them will be long lasting, to the system from throughout the system of the regulatory system. Due to the nature of the virus and the nature of the emergency, it being an acute viral infection, and the need for a diagnostic method, so the primary categories of the technologies that are needed are
    
    And then finally the serology tests. The biggest change to the paradigm is home use tests. Over the years, if you go back from Since I joined the FDA and until 2020, there's talks about What's point of care, definition of point of care, home use, how to meet the case, which indications could be used at home, the risks of putting results in the hands of end users, how will the results be interpreted?
    
    In this short time period, this gap was completely crossed and not in a way that compromises anything. Safety, the outcomes are amazing and the technologies.
    
    It just, it pressure tested the whole system and it showed that it could work. So, also the time to review, which makes sense because it's an emergency use, so already they were in a shorter timeline. However, these were shorter than what usually happens in emergency uses. Subsequent submissions were also easier to get through the agency when the EUA ended.
    
    The regulatory system is now prepared for this, for shorter reviewer times, more effective time to market.
    
    Like I said, not compromising safety and effectiveness. The advancement in technologies, particularly in the home use. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. to produce the results that were approved by the agency in the hands of lay users, and also the ability to share results in a short time.
    
    using all the advances in artificial intelligence and the technological advances opened the door for expansion of diagnostics in general. So now the framework is ready for many, many, many areas that are known and could use it to improve, and also to open for me.
    
    This was a lot of work on the side of the FDA.
    
    Before I leave the slide, I want to touch on the fact that
    
    If you go back in history, for example, viral diagnostics was not really something that is done. It was considered something that is like, the virus is not...
    
    If it's not, it's probably a virus. The result will come two weeks later, for example, if you take that. But with advances of technology and being able to say, OK, it's a virus early on, what happens? Lots of things started to become anti-viral.
    
    And now with this boost, a lot of things are expected to come. And the preparedness of the agency should also augment.
    
    So this is a spin, the LDD. Now the LDD regulatory situation is one of the biggest, I would say, From a regulatory perspective, the biggest developments of this time. This has been for decades. In the making. Until finally in April of 2024, the final rule came, which closed the gap. And now lab-developed tests...
    
    We're supposedly going to be reviewed just as in future diagnostic tests. So lab developers are manufacturers of tests which are used for the same intended use as other devices.
    
    This shift, or policy shift, did not last long, because in April of 2025, the federal court blocked And so, now we're back to the uncertainty. However, the policy, the final rule, is still there. So the idea is, whenever this block goes away, the implementation of the rule is going to come back. When that happens, that's the ambiguity. 
    
    ![page_005_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_005_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    That's the uncertainty. And this, what you see here, is the implementation timeline.
    
    that was discussed in the final rule here. So a four-year phase-out. First year will be NDR and COBRA requirements. And then registration and listing, and then the full quality system, the pre-market review for only the high-risk devices followed by pre-market review.
    
    So the question now is, like, what are labs supposed to do? Is this going to happen? What do they do in this period of uncertainty? Most clinical labs are preparing for it. Because the biggest things you have to adjust now, labs have to invest on quality system, developing a quality system, design inputs, all the different aspects of quality system that they were not previously prepared for.
    
    So...
    
    So basically now, what it means to the labs is that preparing for the implementation is the biggest task. Eventually, this will happen. So this is not going away. There is a final ruling.
    
    So the best thing to do is use this time to prepare for the implementation.
    
    ![page_006_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_006_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    Another big player is the technology evolution in drugs and the market evolution. And I would say that there is a four main...
    
    ...happened that shaped the IVD regulatory situation.
    
    First of all, the molecular diagnostic, the advances in the molecular diagnostic method over the time, particularly as sparked by COVID.
    
    This was one of the biggest highlights in growth in technology related to imaging diagnostics. And it's not only COVID now. We see technological growth in different areas, like oncology. We see the sensitivity and the specificity and the rapidity of these methodologies, opening doors and applications for different things.
    
    You can see the liquid biopsies. There's the minimal residual.
    
    We are putting pressure on the agency for developing the appropriate regulatory pathways. And this is here to stay because it helped a lot.
    
    This is a test that will say simple, you know, yes or no, and you have to wait days for them. Now there's different things such as quantitative, rapid quantitative, network systems, integrating with the electronic health records, and enabling... clinical decision support, so actually actionable results that are benefiting the patients, closing the circles on cycles on different things.
    
    So, yeah.
    
    This is a second major influencer, in my opinion, and the digital health, the software as a medical device component, they are evolving and growing.
    
    The very first considerations and FDA is actively reviewing in the pre-market and also requesting post-market follow-up and compliance related to cybersecurity aspects. Last one is the companion diagnostics. Now that we have the diagnostics which are capable of with sensitivity and specificity, they are reliable to guide
    
    The state of the science or state of the medicine. So there is an expansion in different technologies, in different applications, including gene therapy, cell and tissue therapies, and other oncology applications.
    
    Check it out.
    
    ![page_007_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_007_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    I'm going to focus on the EU and the situation of the IVD. So we can no longer, like the FDA, the US IVD market is The biggest market, but it is not a stand-alone market. It cannot exist in a vacuum anymore. Most of the manufacturers have products in the U.S. and outside the U.S.
    
    And hence, it's also affected by what's happening in the regulatory bodies outside. What happened is shift. to the IVDR. IVDR is now significantly more stringent than what was there before. It's requiring more clinical evidence, more oversight, and...
    
    And this has its own impact. So there's negative things because companies will have to at some point make decisions to drop one of the markets if the resource allocation is not helping. The supply chain issues and disruptions could also be a result of that. And for a long time, also from the early 2000s, the FDA is working on harmonization.
    
    This movement towards aligning standards and regulatory requirements on the long-term
    
    There is also a potential change to the way the FDA is doing things when it comes to in vitro diagnostics. The takeaway, for example, for companies, for manufacturers, is that don't think about the local market when you are in the early stages of development.
    
    You need to think globally. You need to think about global market and start wherever you want to start. So even if you're starting in the U.S., From day one, keep in mind the global perspective. So while you're designing your regulatory strategy Who is that in mind?
    
    Now back to the FDA and what is CDRH doing? So typically, CDRH puts out the strategic priorities, right?
    
    For the period of 2022 to 2025, FDA did put out strategic priorities, but they're not on the website anymore. They were announced in February of 2022. And they included these three main ones. Promoting a modern and diverse workforce. And actually applications happened. There was hiring announced of many, you know, people with technical, artificial intelligence expertise and all of that.
    
    Enhancing organizational agility and resilience, and advancing health equity. Like I said, these priorities are currently not on the website, right? However, what does this mean? And since January of 2025, it is of note that there has been major organizational changes and other significant changes within FDA's CDRH. We all know now we are in the government.
    
    From the standpoint of where is the center going, there is organizational changes, even at higher levels of the center. So, my current, what I believe would be happening here is that, These strategic priorities will not be revisited this year, but what's most likely to happen is that early next year, new strategic priorities would be
    
    It has been publicly available for 2026 and beyond. So, most likely there will be some changes. The AI experts, we've seen that some of them came back, you know, there's still the hiring, the people who are retained include the artificial intelligence experts.
    
    You can predict what the priorities will be based on what's happening in the market also.
    
    ![page_008_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_008_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    So some things will go and some things will stay, but if you think about what...
    
    ![page_009_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_009_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    From an in vitro diagnostic perspective, what's there to stay? So, most likely, predicting that the device reclassification program will continue. So the agency's effort to sort of down-classify many of the Class 3 devices and just, you know, continue to review what could be down-classified. And so that was also the effort or puts the pressure on the industry to think and to prepare the case for the FDA.
    
    You know, evidence of what are the risks. Why do we believe it's moderators? Subject matter-based evidence. What are the special controls that could be available to mitigate the remaining risks? Okay? And this, in particular, was in those areas that we said are here to grow, like companion diagnostics.
    
    Some infectious disease agents, and also reducing the regulatory burden like this third party program. It was growing. There's lots of areas which the agency is shifting submissions to third parties. That's likely also going to be there to stay. It also includes modernization of guidance, which is in the best interest of companies as well. So, again, another effort or initiative.
    
    Keeping it is in the best interest of the agency and the industry. And that's one of the areas where industry could feed. You know, the ambiguous guidance documents, They're not helpful for the FDA. They're not helpful for the companies. So, the FDA was planning a 50% deduction of the pre-2019 guidance documents, which were all over the place. I'm moving to more...
    
    It's not binding and the messaging in it is not very specific, okay. So taking that and providing from the technical expertise from the The hands, the people who have their hands on the product to develop what would be the specific special controls and provide sufficient justifications to back them, that's good information, you know. These are going to be the publications, these are going to be the things that the agency will go back to in the guidance modernization.
    
    Also, which will hopefully improve the regulatory clarity and help improve the whole regulatory cycle. So, what does this mean? So, yeah.
    
    is to set or lay the ground for these foundational changes which are in the best interest of Promoting innovation.
    
    So these policies are most likely going to stay.
    
    Okay, I'm gonna... I think I might be...
    
    Please feel free to ask questions if you want to stop me at any time. Now, I'm going to move to the impact on the different stakeholders. So, what does all this mean to different stakeholders? And I just, I focus on the clinical labs, which are potentially IVD manufacturers as well. They are going to get the big hit, right? The compliance costs are estimated to be anywhere between $100 million.
    
    40-60% of the clinical labs require significant changes to upgrade their quality system. And this will potentially cause...
    
    It has been edited to include proper punctuation. And so there will also be a burden on the FDA. There's an expectation that there will be 3,000 to 5,000 new LTT submissions projected. The burden on the labs is that they will need to start hiring. We are developing regulatory expertise in-house or figuring out how to source it out because putting together regulatory submissions is not something that clinical labs do carefully.
    
    So they need to figure out how to develop this regulatory expertise, and the agency will have to deal with this. So, most likely the agency will be sourcing out a lot of these after they've carved out the product codes that go to third parties, right?
    
    Then anything that falls in the product code... It will probably end up being disseminated somehow, the same way as devices developed by manufacturers to serve the party, but otherwise this is a huge burden on the agency as well. Now, this challenge for clinical labs actually favors or, you know, it comes in the favor of the IVD manufacturers.
    
    Because the market expansion is expected, because these are already seasoned players, they know what to do, they know how to develop, they have it all ready.
    
    ![page_010_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_010_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    It's a challenging thing for if a manufacturer, actually, most of the lab-developed tests, they start doing clinicals as lab-developed tests, and then... They form the concept that the manufacturer uses at the end, so it can change a little bit how business is run or done.
    
    The FDA review process, I don't anticipate that it will change much. Still, the review times and the approval rates are maintained. One big impact of all of these challenges on industry is that industry needs to develop their grade and develop their AI.
    
    So step up their AI, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, and cyber security, and the quality considerations around these. Because that's where you are going to stand out from other industries. The global IVD market is projected to be valued at between $108.3 billion in 2024. Sorry, this is...
    
    So basically, what would an IVD manufacturer, so the strategic, I mean, what would an IVD The takeaways here is to invest in capabilities that differentiate your particular industry, including, for example, advancement in technologies, the robust quality systems.
    
    It has been edited to include proper punctuation. It has been edited to include proper punctuation. For those who can navigate these complex regulatory challenges.
    
    ![page_011_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_011_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    Okay, I'm going to wrap up with some emerging trends in tickles. So, in the short term... We're waiting to see what happens with the LDT because that's going to cause a big change, like we just said. Potentially, the valid act movement might be the first one.
    
    And the industry will have to gradually adapt to that. In the meanwhile, labs are starting to work on their quality systems. And industry, you know, should also try to see how to bridge the gaps of the different reliability on lab-developed tests and how that would change after the regulation comes in place.
    
    In the long term, like first evolution towards like sophisticated risk-based approaches. For example, right now FDA is getting better at... Sizing the regulation to the risk, so not everything is blown into FOS3, PMA, you know, or applying sort of the one-size-fits-all.
    
    And since that's a direction that's here to stay, and it's in the best interest of both parts, this is where we are. The greater emphasis on artificial intelligence and machine learning, cybersecurity, transparency. There's also the issue of expanded real world.
    
    The clinical study design itself is changing. So the ability for FDA to require these clinical studies, the typical clinical study design, is not. It's not going to hold for the expectations, so real-world evidence is expanding and expected to expand more if the use case or the case for use is well established.
    
    And so investing on actually having real world evidence that's usable for regulatory grade is an important thing to do and to have. We have that in consideration in early stages of development.
    
    I think the COVID, the pressure test for the COVID-19 has been like a proof for FDA's ability to adapt.
    
    You should just start from there, not go back. The LDT regulation thing, I think we talked about it enough. The precision medicine grows.
    
    So now the FDA works with more advanced pre-submission strategies, there's ongoing dialogue, the breakthrough, Submissions and all of these things are important. Takeaways that happened. The digital health and cybersecurity are now priorities to consider. And voice development and the harmonization efforts.
    
    ![page_012_3. Trends in US Regulation of IVDS 2020 to 2025 HS ELMUBARAK 102325.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_012_3._Trends_in_US_Regulation_of_IVDS_2020_to_2025_HS_ELMUBARAK_102325.jpg)
    
    This is my last slide. So thank you all for your attention.
    
    And I just wanted to share, this is my QR code. I work in IVD Consulting, as I think I talked to many of you. And we will be distributing also flyers for people who don't have them. Please let us know, you know, just reach out. We'll be happy to be part of your journeys in IP development.
    
    And I thank the organization for doing it for me.
    
    Does anyone have any questions?
    
    Thank you for keeping your time. We have 10 minutes more. I have one question.
    
    As you know, in case of LDT, it's very important for us because, as you know, it's easier to enter into the United States market, and LDT is a very good solution. I'm just surprised by your opinion. Because currently, as you know, Texas County, they have to block the LDT process for FDA.
    
    How do you think in the future, continuous blocking is easy to LDT or FDA? So as of now, in this period of uncertainty, I think people can continue to do the previous thing of putting it in LTE. So it's going to happen. So LDT, the way it was used in the past, it's not going to halt. So starting to look about what is the alternative strategy, right? What do you put there so you can use things which are here to stay, like the real world evidence situation?
    
    Like where would you put the device so it's not like a research use? It's going to be under the FDA regulation. Of course, the FDA made exemptions, so if you are within those exemptions, like rare diseases, all of these, like, the device types that the FDA will not take out because of their need and they cannot subject them to the process yet, then that will continue.
    
    But anything other than that, this is the time now to...
    
    For example, we prefer it to the FDA, or some clinical data from the United States. However, IVDR, we use 100% United States clinical data. Or, secondly, we need to do more testing in the United States.
    
    So I just have a question. Yeah, we usually do 100% using our United States data, or do we need extra testing for clinical testing in Europe? I can't say definitively for a broader thing, but what I've seen so far is that the U.S. is more... You have to have 70% of EU-based data. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.
    
    Any questions?
    
    Okay, thank you for your time.
    
    Summary
    
    ### Overview
    
    - Presentation focuses on major forces reshaping the regulatory landscape for in vitro diagnostics (IVDs) from 2020 to 2025.
    - The period has been characterized by rapid innovation, growth of global markets, and unprecedented regulatory adaptation by the FDA.
    - Four major forces driving regulatory changes: COVID-19 emergency response, technology evolution, LDT regulatory oversight shifts, and impact of global markets.
    
    ### COVID-19 Impact
    
    - Record-breaking Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submissions between March 2020 and May 2023 exceeded all previous emergencies combined.
    - Pandemic created a paradigm shift for home use tests, overcoming previous regulatory hurdles without compromising safety.
    - Shorter review times became standard, improving time-to-market efficiency.
    - Technological advancements in home diagnostics created a framework ready for expansion into other areas.
    
    ### LDT Regulatory Changes
    
    - Final rule issued in April 2024 would regulate Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) the same as other IVDs.
    - Federal court blocked implementation in April 2025, creating regulatory uncertainty.
    - Original plan included a four-year phase-out timeline with graduated requirements.
    - Most clinical labs are preparing for eventual implementation despite current uncertainty.
    
    ### Technology & Market Evolution
    
    - Major advancements in molecular diagnostic methods, particularly accelerated by COVID.
    - Growth areas include liquid biopsies, rapid quantitative testing, and network systems integrated with electronic health records.
    - Digital health and software as medical devices are evolving with increasing cybersecurity considerations.
    - Expansion of companion diagnostics in various applications, including gene therapy and oncology.
    
    ### Global Regulatory Influences
    
    - US IVD market cannot exist in isolation as most manufacturers operate globally.
    - EU's shift to IVDR regulations has created more stringent requirements for clinical evidence and oversight.
    - FDA has been working on harmonization of standards and regulatory requirements since early 2000s.
    - Companies need to adopt a global perspective from the earliest stages of development.
    
    ### FDA Strategic Direction
    
    - CDRH published strategic priorities for 2022-2025 focusing on workforce modernization, organizational agility, and health equity.
    - Significant organizational changes have occurred within FDA's CDRH since January 2025.
    - New strategic priorities are expected to be published in early 2026.
    - Device reclassification program, third-party review programs, and guidance modernization likely to continue.
    
    ### Impact on Stakeholders
    
    - Clinical labs face compliance costs estimated between $100 million, with 40-60% requiring significant quality system upgrades.
    - FDA anticipates 3,000-5,000 new LDT submissions, creating burden on both labs and the agency.
    - Labs will need to develop regulatory expertise or outsource submission preparation.
    - IVD manufacturers may benefit from market expansion as they already have regulatory processes in place.
    - Global IVD market projected to reach $108.3 billion in 2024.
    
    ### Emerging Trends
    
    - Short-term: Uncertainty around LDT regulation implementation while labs improve quality systems.
    - Long-term: Evolution toward sophisticated risk-based regulatory approaches.
    - Greater emphasis on AI/ML, cybersecurity, and transparency in device development.
    - Expanded use of real-world evidence for regulatory submissions.
    - Growth in precision medicine with ongoing regulatory dialogue through pre-submission programs.
    
    ### Action Items
    
    - [ ]  Clinical labs should invest in developing quality systems in preparation for eventual LDT regulation.
    - [ ]  Manufacturers should adopt global perspective from day one of product development.
    - [ ]  Companies should invest in AI/ML capabilities and robust cybersecurity to differentiate themselves.
    - [ ]  Industry should prepare regulatory-grade real-world evidence for submissions.
    - [ ]  Organizations should engage with FDA through pre-submission strategies and ongoing dialogue.

"FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases"
    
    Summary
    
    ### 발표자 및 회사 소개
    
    - 나노다이테일(NanoDetail)의 장병식 대표가 FDA 승인 전략에 대해 발표
    - 2002년 뉴저지에서 설립되어 진단 제품 개발 및 생산 판매 중
    - 약 1년 반 동안 3개 제품에 대한 FDA 승인 취득 성과
        - 2022년 2월: 코비드 진단 제품
        - 2022년 7월: 6세 미만 영유아용 RSV 제품
        - 2023년 6월: 코비드와 독감 동시 검사 제품
    
    ### FDA 승인 접근 방식
    
    - 특별한 비법보다는 기초적이지만 자주 간과되는 중요 사항들에 초점
    - 각 회사의 목적에 맞게 맞춤형 준비가 필요함
    
    ### 주요 고려사항과 실수 방지 포인트
    
    ### 비교 제품 선정
    
    - FDA 정식 승인된 제품을 반드시 비교 대상으로 선정해야 함
    - 주정부 승인(예: 뉴욕 헬스킷)과 연방정부(FDA) 승인의 차이 이해 필요
    - 클리어 랩이나 큰 기관의 제품이라도 FDA 승인 여부 반드시 확인
    
    ### 임상시험 설계
    
    - 1개의 임상시험에는 1개의 비교 제품 사용 권장
    - 여러 종류의 비교 장비 사용 시 동등성 인증 작업 필요
    - 반복된 환자 샘플 사용 주의 (같은 환자의 여러 샘플이 포함되면 결과 왜곡)
    
    ### 지역적 다양성
    
    - 미국 내 최소 3개 이상의 지역에서 샘플 수집 필요
    - 동서남북 중부 등 다른 지역 선택 권장
    - 한국에서 수집한 임상 데이터는 미국 FDA 승인에 사용 불가 - 반드시 미국 내 데이터 필요
    
    ### 인구통계학적 균형
    
    - 연령대: 목표 질병에 맞는 연령 분포 필요 (예: 소아용 RSV 제품은 10세 미만 비율 적절해야 함)
    - 성별: 남녀 비율 균형 유지 (목표 질병 특성 고려)
    - 인종: 다양한 인종 포함 필요 (히스패닉 등)
    
    ### FDA 제출 방법 및 도구
    
    - eSTAR 또는 pre-eSTAR 시스템 활용 권장
    - 장점:
        - 제출 프로세스 간소화
        - 템플릿에 FDA 요구사항이 모두 포함됨
        - 빠뜨린 부분 없이 효율적으로 준비 가능
    - Q-SUB을 통한 사전 확인 활용
    
    ### 성공 요약
    
    - 특별한 비결보다는 기본에 충실하고 실수를 방지하는 것이 중요
    - 미국을 대표할 수 있는 적절한 임상 데이터가 승인의 핵심
    
    ### 행동 항목
    
    - [ ]  FDA 정식 승인된 비교 제품 선정 여부 확인
    - [ ]  임상시험 시 지역적 다양성 확보 (최소 3개 이상 미국 지역)
    - [ ]  환자 샘플의 중복 여부 검증 시스템 구축
    - [ ]  인구통계학적 균형 확보 전략 수립 (연령, 성별, 인종)
    - [ ]  eSTAR/pre-eSTAR 시스템 활용 준비

    네, 안녕하십니까. 나노다이테일 장병식입니다. 지금 말씀해주신 것 같이 FDA 성공 전약, 성공적인 스크린 플라스틱을 드리겠습니다.
    
    ![page_001_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_001_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    ![page_002_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_002_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    저희 회사는 2002년도에 뉴저지에서 설립되었구요. 현재 계속해서 라이브니 제품은 개발하고 생산 재료 판매를 하고 있습니다.
    
    ![page_003_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_003_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    제가 오늘 이 자리에 서게 된 이유가 작년 2월달 부터 한 1년 반정도 걸쳐가지고 3개의 제품을 FK 빨대기 승리 받았습니다. 전 아직 좀 배고프고 더 많이 받고 싶은데 옆에서 보실 경우에는 좀 짧은 시간 내에 성과를 이뤘다고 생각하시는 분들이 많으셔가지고
    
    어떻게 했는지 그 방법이 궁금하신 것도 있으실 것 같고 저희 그 비법을 전수하고 싶은 게 있다고 하면 이번 기회에 정리하면 좋겠다 생각해서 하겠다 말씀드렸는데요. 일단 저희는 작년도 2월에 코비드 제품에 대해서 파이팅을 받았고 작년 7월달 정도에는 저희가 RSV제품 6세미만 영유아에서 감염되는 제품에 대해서 저희가 딸틴트를 받았습니다. 또한 금년 6월달에 코비드하고 플룻을 동시에 검사할 수 있는 제품 승인받았습니다. 그래서 또한 저희가 지금 한 개의 제품을 더 리뷰하고 있고 조만간 승인받을 거 예상하고 있는데요. 
    
    ![page_004_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_004_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    그래서 저도 이런 질문 받을 때마다
    
    나한테 무슨 특별 비법이 있을까 아니면 나한테 어떤 성공 전략이 있을까 정말 고민을 해봤거든요
    
    심지어는 회사에서 프리젠테이션 준비할 때 직원들 그때 같이 하셨던 분들한테 여쭤봤습니다. 아까 어떻게 했기 때문에 우리가 이렇게 그리고 제품을 수입 받았으니까 많은 시간을 가졌어도 특별하게 답이 없습니다. 그래서 저희가 생각해 봐도 그냥 FDA에서 요구하고 있는 뭐 세이프키나 이펙트 리스에 믿다는지 자체 검사를 하고 확인하고 또는 FDA에서 제공하고 있는 가이덴스나 또 피디케이트 결과 보고서 어 우리가 더 좋다 안 좋다 평가할 수 밖에 없는 입장이거든요. 그래서 잘하면 되는데 어떻게 잘해야 되지? 나는 답이 없는 것 같습니다. 그래서 한 번 어떤 루션 보시는데 정말 답이 없어가지고
    
    뭐 운이 좋아서 나오기에 대답한 적도 있고 아니면 아니면은 하나님이 도우셔가지고 이렇게 대답한 수밖에 없었고요. 그래서 저는 오늘 그 자리에서 특별하게 방법보다는
    
    저희가 이것만은 좀 실수하지 말자 그래야지만 성공을 좀 땡길 수 있지 않을까 우리가 흔히 기초적인 거지만은 자주
    
    주의깊게 안 봐가지고 넘어가는 부분들이 많이 있는 것 같습니다. 그거에 대해서 제가 한 5년 정도 코비드를 겪으면서 팩트했던 거에 대해서 조금 공유 드리면은 새롭게 시작하시는 분들 또는 지금 하시는 분들한테 도움이 되지 않을까 생각이 듭니다.
    
    ![page_005_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_005_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    저희 제품은 레피드 제품이어서 기존에 승인받은 제품과 프리스케이지 제품과 비교하게 되어있습니다. 그 비교를 통해가지고 어느 만큼 민감한지, 어느 만큼 정확한지
    
    호빈엔티즌을 검사했을 제품 개발해가지고 임사 다 끝난 다음에 야, 이렇게 FDA 제출하고 승인받을 거야. 왜냐하면 다른 제품들보다 성능이 좋았거든요. 그래서 열심히 준비해가지고 2021년도에 제출했습니다. 근데 답을 받은게 내가 쓴 크리티케이트 제품은 FD3 받은 제품이 아니야. 왜? 아니 왜? 이렇게 큰 더블피셜 왜 제품, 피셜 제품이 앞에 있고 나는 아퓨티스한 랩에서 평가했는데 왜? 너무 당황스럽기도 하고 이게 어떻게 내가 그런걸 놓쳤을까 왜 큰 회사 마케팅사 내부에서는 이런 제품을
    
    ![page_006_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_006_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    쓰고 있지?라는 질문이 생겼습니다. 결국은 저희는 FDA로 워크업을 할 수 없기 때문에 내가 마켓 FDA 정식 승인된 제품을 첫번째 선정하셔야 된다는게 제가 지금 말씀드리고 싶습니다. 그럼 말씀드린거같이 그러면 이 아피끼스 랩에서는 왜 이 제품을 쓸수가 있었지? 그 다음에 두번째 질문 그런데 한국 같은 경우에는 크게 지방정부, 연방정부, 중앙정부 차이가 없지만 미국은 아쉽게도 주정부하고 영광입니다. 지금까지 마치겠습니다.
    
    그래서 아퓨티스에서 쓰는 제품 같은 경우는 이렇게 FDA 승인된 제품만으로 분명히 녹취되어 있습니다. 하지만 뉴욕 헬스킷 같은 업체에서 승인된 제품이다. 그래서 뉴욕 주요 내에서는 쓸 수가 있습니다. 사용할 수 있습니다. 뭐 그때 EUA, 코비드 때 이기 때문에 또
    
    미국이 연방정부하고 주정부하고 차이가 심하구나 그래서 무조건 큰 레벨에서 사용한다고 하더라도 그 제품에 대해서는 한 번정도는 정말 FD3D 제품인지를 꼭 확인하고 진행해야겠다는 생각이 들었습니다. 
    
    ![page_007_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_007_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    한국에서 진출하실 때 클리어 랩을 통해 많이 진출하시는 것 같아요. 근데 저희 같은 입장에서는 클리어 랩 또는 큰 시설 같은 경우는 무조건 100% 실내하면서 그 결과 늘릴 수 밖에 없습니다. 확인한다. 뭐 다 비쩍 아우 저 큰 애들 사는데 설마 애플이 승리 받지 않지 브이였어? 라는게 저희는 한국에서 오신 분들 또 저같이 처음 시작한 사람들한테는 많이 캐스팅 생기는 분야거든요
    
    하지만 엑스테이에서는 단지 랩에서 겨다니는 LBT 테스트가 돼서 그걸 공식 데이터로 인정해줬다. 물론 이 데이터가 환자가 의사한테 제공해가지고 어떻게 할거냐, 뭐 제가 알려드린것 같이 D-NO로 통해서 갈수도 있는데요, 그전에 Q-SUB을 통해서 X-RAY를 할거에요.
    
    그래서 만약에 그런 비교 실험도 없다고 하시면 또 다음에 저희가 랩에서 검사한 결과 갖고 모아서 재추사신다고 하면 그 전에 큰 윙스... 사업을 하시기 전에, 데이터를 모으시기 전에, 반드시 2개의 역사학을 하시는 게 첫 번째 수단인 것 같습니다.
    
    ![page_008_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_008_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    다음엔 이건 저희가 조금은 제 케이스인데요, 과거스럽게 제가 정리했구나라는 간섭이 있는 부분이죠. 저희는 잘 몰랐었던 것 같아요. 그때 시점에서는. 코비드 샘플을 모았는데요, 이렇게 저희가 샘플 병원이나 샘플맵이나 유펜이나 퀘스트로 놀 수 있었던 큰 병원에서 샘플을 모았습니다. 검색을 해보니까 너무너무 결과가 좋은거에요. 그래서 이 데이터를 똑같이 FD에 냈습니다. 근데 FD 데이터는 여기서 각각 사이트에서 사용한 PCR 방법이 다 똑같아. 네가 동등하다는 걸 유추할 수가 있어. 동등하다는 걸 유추한 상태에서 이런 데이터가 분석이 돼야 되는데
    
    그걸 니가 입증할 수 있니? 라는 질문을 받았거든요. 물론 이 각각의 제품은 그 중에서 FD 승인된 제품도 있습니다. 하지만 승인된 제품이 3개의 제품이 있을 경우에 3개가 다 똑같은 성적을 결과를 보일 수 있느냐 이렇게 하는 것은 아니거든요. 그래서 가능하시면은 1개의 클리닉칼을 진행하실때는 1개의 컴퓨터를 사용하시기 바랍니다.
    
    여러가지 종류의 피셜 머신, 프리티켓 등을 이용해서 동등성 인증하는 작업을 준비하셔야 합니다.
    
    ![page_009_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_009_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    지금부터는 조금 편하게 말씀드리겠습니다. 저희가 인상을 하게 되면 한 명의 환자에서 한 명을 세팅합니다.
    
    한 3개월동안 300개만 모아주세요, 500개 모아주세요 라고 저희가 얘기할 수 밖에 없거든요 그쪽도 그래야지만 그 기간에 맞춰가지고 샘플을 모아서 해줄 수 밖에 없으니까요 그러면 그 사이에 같은 환자가 계속 와가지고 이상일 감독이 오셔가지고 샘플을 써서 샘플을 모으는거죠 샘플을 모아있는데 니가 그냥 여기서 반 구역 반 해가지고 샘플 일주일 간격으로 하면 그분이 리피틴의 환자가 되는 샘플이 될 수 있기때문에 크게 대가의 바이러스가 생길 수 있습니다. 특히 주의해야 될 점은
    
    저희가 뉴욕에 있는 M병원에서 샘플을 받았는데요. 저희는 플라즈마를 받았는데 이 병원 내에서는 저희가 이렇게 3월 29일에 입원한 다음에 15, 16, 17, 한 간격으로 이렇게 뽑은 겁니다. 몇 분이 뽑아가지고, 버린 그 병원 내에서는 거기에 항체가 있는지 검사해야 되기 때문에 갖고 와서 검사를 했는데 제가 이 샘플을 맥북으로 받았는데, 이게 반복된 샘플이 되기 시작합니다.
    
    그래서 저희가 이 샘플을 본 다음에 반복된 샘플이 있다고 하면 보시는 것과 같이 샘플 사이즈가 이리저리 조작돼. 이 근상대의 결과를 볼 수가 있고 이 결과가 정말 민간도나 특기도에 정확히 반영할 수 있을까 하는 궁금증이 생길 수 밖에 없을 것 같습니다.
    
    ![page_010_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_010_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    그래서 그 다음에 제가 조금 말씀드린 내용은 미국 같은 경우에는 좀 땅이 큽니다. 한국에 비해서는 너무 크기 때문에요. 우리 바이러스를 본다고 하더라도 3개 지역 이상에서 샘플을 모아서 검사하게 되어있습니다. 그럼 저희가 생각할 때 3개 지역이면 어떤 부분 정도 해야 될까요?
    
    뉴욕, 뉴저지, 펜신비아니아, 세계중요한 엑세이가 맞추고 있나요?
    
    보통 저희가 쓸 경우에는 최소한 이스트보스, 웨스트보스, 남북, 북북, 중국 다섯개 룬을 사용합니다. 나누신 다음에 그 중에 3개를 선택하시는 게 가장 좋은 방법입니다. 가장 좋은 것은 동서남북한 게 좋긴 좋은데요. 그렇게까지 쉽지 않다고 하더라도 최선 3개 지역을 구분하셔가지고 하시는 게 좋습니다.
    
    한 지역만 미수하신다고 하면은 그 대표성에서 문제가 될 수밖에 없기 때문에 3개 이상 하셔야 될 것 같고 또한 어떤 특정 질병같은 경우에 이렇게 환경에 의해서 많이 차이가 날 수도 있습니다. 환경도 보유하셔야 되고 한국에서 검사한 데이터를, 임상 데이터를 미국에 쓸 수가 있느냐, 참견할 수 있는데 쓰시는 분들은 아십니다. 반드시 미국 베이스 크레이더 스파이가 되셔야 합니다. 물론 그 숫자나 사이트 숫자 같은 경우에는 전체 샌드 숫자나 사이트 숫자는 FDA에서 확인하실 수가 있지만 반드시 미국 내 대표성 갖고 있는 사이트에서 하셔야 됩니다.
    
    ![page_011_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_011_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    또 다음에 말씀드리는 내용은 환자 A지의 파프리에이션인데요. 한쪽에 치우치거나 하시지 않으시면 안됩니다. 만약에 저희가 샘플을 모았을 경우에 특정 20대, 30대 데이터 갖고서 이게 10세 미만 아이에 적용할 수 있다 또는 60세 이상에 적용할 수 있다라고
    
    소아 RSV나 플루 같은 경우에는 특히 소아에 많이 관련이 되기 때문에 소아 10세 미만 아이에 대한 비율이 정확히 적합하셔야됩니다. 하지만 데이터는 인정받으실 수가 있습니다. 그래서 언제나 A시 보는 아이들, 시 어벌트까지 포함된 데이터가 나와야 하지만
    
    ![page_012_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_012_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    요새 많이 문제시 되고 있는 젠더입니다. 그저께 뉴스인가요? 위고비라는 이야기가 나왔습니다. 데이트하는건 신뢰하겠지만 실제 임상 데이터가 여성이 남성보다 2배 더 많이 참가했답니다. 그래서 여성이 더 비만에 많이 빠지는건가? 아니면 왜 여성이 많이 참가했지? 라는 질문이 생길 수 있겠지만 저희 입장에서는 남성 여성 비율이 우리가 목적한
    
    어떤 질병 같은 경우에 어떤 타겟팅 하는 대상 같은 경우에는 한쪽 성에 치우칠 가능성이 있는데 그 목적에 맞게 맞추셔야 될 것 같고 요새 제가 준비한, 재밌게 만든거는 젠더 이슈 중에서 만약에 바이올로지칼 젠더하고 자기 생각하는 젠더가 다 달랐을때 수술을 통해서 바뀔 수 있는 경우는 어떻게 할 거냐에 대한 고민도 한 번 정도는 저희가 나중에는 하게 되지 않을까
    
    ![page_013_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_013_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    마지막, 제가 에어 쪽의 마지막 부분인데요, 더 크게는 문제는 없으실 것 같아요.
    
    저희가 조금은 트렌드를 보셔야 할 것 중 하나가 지금 옛날보다는 이렇게 히스패닉 시청해주셔서 감사합니다.
    
    규모가 보이기 때문에 데이터 내에서 인종 간의 밸런스까지 맞춰야 한다고 생각합니다. 두번째는 대부분 한인이시기 때문에 인사는 하게 될 수 있기 때문에 보통 한인이 운영하는 닥터오피스에 가서 많이 하실거에요. 그러면 LCP
    
    그거에 대한 디펜스도 고민하셔야 합니다. 그래서 가능하시면은 뭐 할인 부인 또 하실 수도 있겠지만 가능하시면은
    
    ![page_014_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_014_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    네, 그래서 앞에 말씀드린 것 같이 임상준비를 많이 하시다 보면 되게 궁금한게 많으실거에요. 네, 이런 모임을 통해서 저희가 답을 받을 수 있지만 가장 쉽고 확실한 방법은 좀 시간은 70분 정도 걸리지만 가장 확실한 방법은
    
    저도 지금 5DD 제출할때는 E-STAR 버전을 많이 이용하고 있고 또는 Q-SERVE 할때는 프리-E-STAR 버전을 많이 이용하고 있는데요. 가장 좋은 점은 옛날같은 경우 팩스 보내고, 목표보내고, 책 써가지고 보내고, 클리어 된다는 거 다 하면서 진행을 했었는데, 가장 쉬운거는 그 프로세스를 몰입할 수 있는게 너무 좋고. 두번째는 그 템플릿안에 애플리케이션의 s답이 있는 요구하고 있는 리퀘이먼트가 하나씩 다 들어있습니다. 그걸 보다 그 각을 쓰시면서 보다보면은
    
    정확하게 FBA에서 리플레이 할 수가 있고 저희가 그걸 보면서 빠진 부분 없이 시간을 잘 낮출 수 있는 플랫폼으로 사용할 수 있을 것 같습니다. 가능하시면 이스타나 트리스타를 사용하시면 가장 좋은 방법입니다.
    
    다큐멘터리를 제가 프린트 할 필요가 없습니다. 어떤 경우에는 로우 데이터가 엑셀이나 하다보면 몇개씩 되는데요. 그거 갖고 있는 것이 쉽지 않거든요. 그냥 그거 보내는 것도 쉽지가 않은데. 새해 복 많이 받으시고, 힘든데 저는 정말 예쁘게 감사하고 있습니다. 너무 잘 얘기해주셔서 감사합니다.
    
    ![page_015_4. FDA Approval Strategies and Success Cases(JBC).jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_015_4._FDA_Approval_Strategies_and_Success_Cases(JBC).jpg)
    
    지금까지 말씀드린 것 같이 저도 어떤 FDA 성공 전략에 대해서 정확하게 A입니다, 말씀해주셨지만
    
    회사별로 그 목적에 맞게 준비할 수밖에 없다 라고 좀 말씀드리고 싶고
    
    두 가지 정도는 좀 말씀드리고 싶습니다. 한 가지는
    
    시청해주셔서 감사합니다.
    
    두번째는 미국을 대표할 수 있는 시성 데이터가 나와야지만 크게 문제없이 승인 받으실 수 있는 것 같습니다.
    
    여기까지 준비해 주셔서 감사합니다.
    
    사실 처음에 제가 궁금했던 것도.

    Summary
    
    ### 미국 시장의 중요성
    
    - 글로벌 의료기기 시장은 약 5백억 달러 규모이며, 미국 시장은 전체 산업의 약 40-45%를 차지하는 최대 단일 시장임
    - 미국 FDA 승인은 글로벌 시장 진출의 핵심 열쇠로, 한 번의 승인으로 전 세계 시장에 접근 가능한 큰 장점이 있음
    - 한국 시장은 글로벌 시장의 약 1.6%에 불과해 지속가능한 비즈니스를 위해서는 미국 시장 진출이 필수적임
    
    ### FDA의 의료기기 규제 관점
    
    - FDA는 21 CFR 820 품질 시스템 규정(QSR)에 따라 의료기기를 규제함
    - 규제는 장벽이 될 수 있지만 동시에 기회가 될 수도 있음 - FDA 가이드라인은 상세한 방향을 제시함
    - 의료기기 규제는 법률에 기반하므로 정확히 따라야 함
    
    ### FDA 승인 준비 전략
    
    - 초기 단계부터 FDA 승인 전략을 고려해야 함 - 제품 디자인 시작부터 상용화까지 역순으로 계획
    - 기술 혁신이 기반이 되어야 하지만, 상용화를 위해서는 품질(퀄리티)과 규제(레귤레이션) 두 가지 필러가 필수적임
    - 사전 FDA 미팅(Pre-submission)은 매우 중요하고 강력한 전략
    - 의료기기는 다양한 이해관계자(사용자, 테스터, 구매자, 사용 시설, 보험 등)가 모두 다르므로 제품 디자인 시 모든 이해관계자를 고려해야 함
    
    ### 문서화 요구사항
    
    - "문서화되지 않은 것은 발생하지 않은 것" - 모든 과정은 철저한 문서화가 필수적임
    - 문서화는 개발 단계(Development)에서 시작해야 하며, 이때부터 디자인 제어(Design Control)가 시작됨
    - 디자인 컨트롤 요소: 디자인 인풋, 디자인 리뷰, 디자인 아웃풋, 디자인 검증, 디자인 변경 관리 등을 포함
    - 회사의 문서와 FDA 요구사항 간의 격차 분석(Gap Analysis)이 필요함
    
    ### 피해야 할 실수
    
    - 명확한 규제 경로(Regulatory Pathway) 없이 제품 개발 시작
    - 디자인 컨트롤 프로세스를 따르지 않은 채 데이터 수집
    - 데이터의 추적성(Traceability) 부족
    - FDA 임상 시험 시작 후 실패는 큰 타격이 되므로, 철저한 사전 준비 필요
    
    ### 성공 요인
    
    - 초기 단계부터 철저한 계획 수립 - 상용화를 위한 역방향 계획
    - 전문가 활용 및 적극적인 커뮤니케이션
    - 체계적인 로드맵 구축이 매우 중요함
    - 데이터 중심 접근 방식 유지
    
    ### 행동 계획
    
    - [ ]  제품 디자인 초기 단계부터 FDA 승인 전략 고려하기
    - [ ]  디자인 컨트롤 문서화 요구사항 준수하기
    - [ ]  회사 문서와 FDA 요구사항 간의 격차 분석(Gap Analysis) 수행하기

    너무 잘 준비해 주셔가지고 어떻게 해야 될지 모르겠네요.

    제목은 FDA 프랜커리션 글로벌 스테이더지 미국 마켓을 위해서 이렇게 작성했습니다.
    
    장대표님께서는 실제로 이런 의심상을 해보다 그 의미를 가득을 할 때 이제 실험실에서 이렇게 어느분께서 이 결과물을 가질 때 어떤 팁들을 말씀 드렸는데요. 굉장히 좋은 사람이 됩니다. 사실 그런 것들이 교과서에 안 나와 있는 거라 수용 안정적이라고 가르칠 수 없는 것 같아요. 네, 그런 팁들과 더불어서 FDA가 바라보는 관점에 우리가
    
    시장에서 어떻게 접근해야 되느냐를 좀 개척을 하고요. 그리고 실제로 커뮤니케이션이 가장 큰 이슈잖아요. 몇 개를 가면 그 다음엔 어떻게 할 것인가, 그 다음엔 어떻게 할 것인가 그런 것들은 오후 세션에 계속 나올 예정인데 그런 것들을 좀 더 생각해 볼 수 있는 시간을

    그래서 오늘 커버를 할꺼는 첫번째, 왜 미국 마켓인가, 미국이 개인 땅이고
    
    FDA가 우리 의료기구를 바라보는 관점이 뭡니까?
    
    다시 한번 설명을 드리고 실제로 우리가 그 리파노를 밋하기 위해서는 뭘 해야 됩니까 이런 것들을 좀 더 대화의 쪽으로 말씀을 드리겠습니다.
    
    당연히 우리 보호병원은 실제로 US 마켓에 들어가기 위해서 FTA가 첫번째 반응이 될텐데 그걸 어떻게 달려들 수 있을지 실제로... 프레임워크를 만들어서 거기에 하나의 체크리스트처럼 그렇게 되게 좋겠다는게 제 반응입니다. 이렇게 염두에 관련해가지고 하면 이제 회사에 가면 톡을 하는 4시간짜리 프로그램을 만들기도 하고 한 8시간 정도 이틀에 걸쳐서 이렇게 했는데 오늘은 20분 내에 굉장히 빠르게 주말 환상식으로 지내도록 하겠습니다.
    
    ![page_004_5. KAMDA 25 Conference Deck - Jay Han Deck 25-10-23.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_004_5._KAMDA_25_Conference_Deck_-_Jay_Han_Deck_25-10-23.jpg)
    
    ![page_005_5. KAMDA 25 Conference Deck - Jay Han Deck 25-10-23.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_005_5._KAMDA_25_Conference_Deck_-_Jay_Han_Deck_25-10-23.jpg)
    
     당연히 커브셀러의 키죠. 글로벌 마켓은 한 5백.. 그.. 120배리아 정도 되는 마켓인데 전체 그..
    
    계속 늘어나고 투런이 떠오르는 것 같고, 투리리언을 봐야 되는 것 같아요. 그 중에 맥더 디바이스는 전체적으로 한 6%의 지연을 가지고 있습니다. 그중에 우리나라 마켓이 한 1.6% 됩니다. 그래도 많이 늘어난거죠. 5년정도만 1%가 됐습니다. 지역적이거나 마켓사이즈 때문에 우리나라에서만 그 디바이스가 탈락하기에는 서스테인 하도록 하자. 그래서 당연히 미국시장으로 가야 됩니다. 미국시장은 거의 전 인더스트리트 분야에서 40%는 45% 정도의 쉬료를 가지고 있고요. 그리고 가장 큰, 이게 꽤 중요한데 싱글 마켓입니다. 싱글 마켓. 저게 가장 큰 건데.
    
    싱글 마켓이라는 의료기기는요. 의료기기는 어떤 비즈니스냐. 우리가 혁신 비즈니스. . . . . . . . . .. 이 FDA를 통과하면 전세계의 바니시장을 그냥 싱글 액세서리로 보는 거예요. 한국만 통과하면 전세계 바니시장에 액세서리.
    
    ![page_006_5. KAMDA 25 Conference Deck - Jay Han Deck 25-10-23.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_006_5._KAMDA_25_Conference_Deck_-_Jay_Han_Deck_25-10-23.jpg)
    
    이렇게 많이 들어갑니다. 사비에이션 맞춰가지고 그런식으로 많이 들어가죠. 그래서 이 단일시장에 들어가는 가장 큰 단일시장에 들어가는 그냥 서로 진검승부를 하기 때문에 글로벌 스탠다드만 사는게 핵이 기울어기 시작해요 그 여러분들이 말씀하셨지만 실제로 미국은 어 레빌레토리도 그렇지만 마켓 자체도 어디 그러니까 주말이랑 다르구요. 레빌레, 그 덤이 다르죠. 그래서 어디로 들어갈거냐 이렇게.
    
    에서 미국을 페넷트릭 하시는 회사들이 미국 전체를 보고 여기 여기 여기 이렇게 하는거에요.
    
    인터페이스가 있다던지, 앱이 있으면 이렇게 된다던지, 여기 로컬에 와서는 여기 로컬에만 바꿔야 되죠. 그런 것들이 많이 중요합니다. 당연히 클리버레이터하고 파트너십이 여기서 찾는게 너무 중요하죠. 미국은 개별 신장, 내가 디바이스라니까, 내가 받은 디바이스라니까 어디가서 직접 영업을 하는 것은 거의 어렵죠. 탑5나 탑10 디스트리밍이 그 전체를 가지고
    
    이게 그 사업자들하고 병원사업자들하고 있는
    
    유스폰셀라이제이션은 가장 중요한게 당연히 테크놀로지가 될 수 있다고 생각합니다. 왜냐면 택조입은 마켓이니까요. 그리고 첫번째 방향이 레귤레토리이기 때문에 이 시입니다.
    
    말씀하시는 경우가 많아요. 근데 물론 그런 면도 있습니다. 있는데 사실 이 레귤레이션이라는 것은 어떤 하나의 벽도 될 수 있지만 기회도 될 수 있어요. 첫번째는 그 벽이 있는데 벽을 넘기만 하면 아까 말씀드린대로 40% 50% 정도 전세계 시장에 되는 단일 마켓에 점핑할 수 있다는 것, 이게 첫번째고요. 두번째는 사실은 FDA가 자세히 보면 우리한테, 맥커니 와이스 매니펜션한테 갈 길을 알려주고 있는 겁니다. 그니까 모창우 선생님이 얘기하셨지만 그런 길들을 가이드라인에 되게 자세한 게 주고 있어요. 조금 있다가 그런 얘기를 한번 해보겠습니다. 그리고 레귤러 트레이너 워리도 하지만 기획가.
    
    그리고 그 다음에 어 오케이 내가 어 저기
    
    그렇게 하는 것보다 이게 거의 페로리안이 하는게 맞습니다 처음에 웨이클 디바이스를 디자인하는 것부터 내가 이걸 가지고 어떤 에어리트링을 할 거예요?
    
    찰 수 있겠는가? 그러면 이게 어떤 식으로 임플로스를 가고 내가 어떻게 수익을 가지고 있겠는가? 이런 것들을 이제 갖게 되네요. 그런 것들을 미리 생각을 해야 됩니다. 리버스 머니가 왜 중요하죠? 당연히 중요하죠 리버스 머니 그럼 거기서 돈이 나오니까
    
    근데 보면 이 메디카드 디바이스 시장은 다른 크루스메 시장과 다르게 이 스테이 골드들이 엄청 많습니다. 당연히 뭐..
    
    스테인불드류는 실제로 그 디바이스를 TV나 차를 산다. 내가 흉내고 내가 로봇을 받아서 오거든요.
    
    뭐 그런거죠. 근데 이 디바이스 부분은 이 조합 이러면은
    
    이 디바이스의 사용자, 디바이스를 테스트하는 대상자, 디바이스를 실제로 가부는, 테스트하는 그 제품에 이 제품이라든지 바뀐다든지 결정하는 사람 그 다음에 그 제품이 사용되는 곳 그리고 그거를 포괄하는 가발란스 이렇게 다 다릅니다. 그래서 누구의 누구의 결정도 완전하다고 할 수는 없지만 누구의 결정도 무시한다고 할 수가 없어요. 스테이 골드가 낫다, 스테이 골드가. 이걸 반드시 해야 되잖아요. 그래서 내가 제품 디자인 할 때도 아, 이 제품은 랩 제품이고, 디바이스고, 우리 랩에서 쓰니까 누구한테 좋게 디자인으로, 설명서도
    
    그 다음에 가격도 이렇게 봐도 되지만 또 다르게 실제로 구매하려는 병원 밖에 있잖아요. 그 스테이플들의 이야기들을 많이 들어야 합니다. 그래서 디자인할 때부터 이거를 생각해야 된다라는 걸 꼭 말씀드리죠. 그렇지 않으면 다 만들고 나서 또 다시 해야되는 경우가 제가 여러 번 본 적이 있습니다. 그래서 이게 이렇게 말할 수 있는데 FDA의 스트레저를 처음부터 생각하는 것, 이게 가장 중요하다. 이렇게 말씀드렸죠. 리버스, 리버스랑 컴퓨터가 어떻게 움직이는가를 보았습니다.
    
    그렇게 말씀 드렸습니다. 자 그러면 FDA preparation approval 할 때 실제적으로 뭐가 중요하고 왜 이걸 해야 된다 이런 것들을 잠깐 이제 주황색
    
    당연히 저희의 목표는 글로벌 커머셜라이저이션입니다. 커머셜라이저이션을 하기 위해서는 모든 기술들은 기본이 테크놀로즈와 이노베이션이 기본이 됩니다. 모든 기반에서 테크놀로즈. 그렇죠. 내 제품이 디퍼런싱, 테크놀리지 와이스 디퍼런싱을 합니다. 여기서 커머셜라이제이션으로 연결할 때 이걸 어떻게 하느냐, 이게 이제 킹인데요. 두 가지 필러가 있습니다. 하나는 매니패킹 필러, 하나는 레귤레이션 필러가 있습니다. 매니패킹을 통해서 퀄리티를 투입하고요. 레귤러션을 통해서 그 나라, 그 정책, 혹은 그 인더스트리에 감염된 컴플라이언스를 필요로 합니다.
    
    이 두가지가 기능 잠시만요 이 두가지를 어떻게 할 것이냐 이게 이제 저희들의 공인이 되는거죠
    
    처음에 마루텍이나 스타드업이나 전부 다 이노베이션이 있고 테크노도 있고 저도 스타드업을 예전에
    
    엑시스 할 경험이 있는데 그때는 잘 몰랐던 것 같아요. 테크노베스와 SM도 이거 만들면 너무 좋은데 이걸 왜 안 살까 이 생각을 하는거에요. 사실은 이제 마켓이 그렇게 돌아가진 않고 그거는 내가 내가 나 좋으라고 하는 건데 그게 아니라 우리가 커머슐라이즈를 생각하려고 하면 두가지를 완성해야합니다. 그게 퀄리티라는 것입니다. 퀄리티는 퍼포먼스입니다. 당연히 있어야 합니다. 5분 남았어요.
    
    많이 있는데요? 하여튼 여기 이게 있습니다. 그러면 요구를 하기 위해서
    
    제가 말씀 드린 이유는 FAA는 맥독 리바이스는 특별히 21 CFR 820, 800 이것의 값을 대상으로 21이 코드 오브 패러디 레귤레이션 이라면 헌법에서부터 정부가 조직이 어떻게 된다고 시작을 해서 21번째 파이들에 훈앤드로그라는 법이 그중에 여러가지 것들이 있는데 800번정도 되면 800번에 H라고 되어있는데 거기에 medical device가 있다. 그 외에 다른것들이 많이 있어요. 그러니까 스토리한테는 어떻게 해야 된다, 각도를 디파해야 된다, 프렉티스한테는 어떻게 해야 된다, 뭐라고 얘기해야 된다, 그렇습니다.
    
    아 그래서 이제 그 800번이 메디컬 디바이스였기 때문에 800번에서도 820번이 퀄리티 시스템 레귤레이션 QSR이라고 하는거죠. 지금은 아마 내년부터는 하모나이즈가 되가지고 두개가 같이 일산 사포로 연결되는 지점이 있습니다. 처음에 FDA를 교육을 받으면 우리 QSR하고 134 바이러스하고 하고 다니지 않은 거를 접했는데 하여튼 그래요. 이렇게 됩니다. 제가 이 말씀을 드리자면 메디클 디바이스를 감안하는 것은 법이라는 겁니다.
    
    이게 뭔가 거리라는 건 락사이스가 아니잖아요. 이게 그냥 있는 그대로 따라가서 이거를 밑 하면서 다가가는 거예요.
    
    그래서 디자인 컨트롤을 어떻게 하는가가 크게, 특히 우리같은 메탈 디바이선에서 굉장히 중요합니다. QnA하고 디자인하고 디자이너하고 디자인 리뷰, 애플리케이션, 베리네이션, 트랜스파워 체인지하고 DHF 이런것들은 그 아메리칼 스터디, IDE같은 경우는 이것은 핸드컨셉측이란, 이걸 실제로 임플리멘트로 해야되는 것입니다. 중요하죠. 인플루엔터 할 때 프로젝트 플랜을 어떻게 쓸 것인가? 뭘 보고 쓸 것인가? 유저와 미디어에서 디자인 코스 넘어 오기 위해서는 어떻게 해야 되는가? DPP를 뭐...
    
    남겨야 되고, 피디언이 있어야 되고, 피디언은 프리미어 디자인 리뷰, 리뷰를 한 번 거쳐야 되고, 이 커널을 만들어주면 프리티컬 디자인 리뷰를 거치고, 트랜스포어에서 프리티컬 스터디, 클린카스터디와 클린카스터디의 경우에는 클린카스터디 프로토콜 스탑 시스템을 이용하면 안될까요? 아까는 제가 법을 말씀드렸는데 두 번째는 다큐멘트의 말씀입니다. 다큐멘트가 없으면 그 일은 안 일어나는 거고요. 다큐멘트가 없으면 그건 없는 겁니다. 이나 그 입장에서 반드시 바꾸면 될 것 같습니다. 실제로 엑스테이 리뷰할 때, 스크린 캡쳐할 때 굉장히 그...
    
    우리 매니저님들이 강구하는 부분 중에 하나에요. 다큐멘터리 언제부터 기억해야 되느냐.
    
    FD에서 얘기하는 것은 리서치가 중간에 가고 디벨롭이 시작할 때, 그때, 그때가 DHCF가 시작하는 거에요. 디벨롭이라는 게 반드시. 그래서 리서치를 한 다음에 디벨롭이 들어간다는 이야기 자체가 디자인 인풋이 나오고요, 디자인 프로토콜이 나오고, 디자인 결과가 나옵니다. 그 얘기니까, 그 때부터 반드시 만들어야 된다.
    
    그래서 뭐 이런 여러가지 것들이나 이런 다큐멘터리도 만들고
    
    제가 하면 4시간에서 8시간짜리 프로그램을 이렇게 만들었는데요. 그래서, 그래서 처음에 하기 전에 이런 거를 다... 거치고 이거는 이제 내가 하는 거야. 그러니까 우리 회사가 하는 거야, 회사가. 그래서 패스가 있느냐, 주느냐, 들느냐를 먼저 결정할 때 대부분은 아마 주겠죠, 소원드리면.
    
    이거는 그냥 딱 가이드 라인에 다 나와있습니다. 파이팅의 기회를 갖느냐, 피해의 기회를 갖느냐, 파이팅의 기회를 갖느냐. 아이디어 같은 것도 되게 많이 가고요.
    
    그래서 아까도 스님이 프리서미션 일이 되게 중요하다고 하셨는데 정말 정말 프리서미션 일이 되게 중요합니다. 굉장히 파워풀하고 인상 깊은 방법이에요.
    
    포멀하기도 하고요. 하지만 이거 할 때 내가 개발을 했을 때 어떤 회사랑 컨트롤을 해서 그 회사를 FD로 가져가겠다고 하면 그 회사가 아까 말씀드렸던 디자인 컨트롤이 다 됐을때 다큐멘트가 많이 나왔는데요, 그 다큐멘트와 FDA가 유일하게 만났을때가 있습니다. 요구하는 다큐멘터리 간의 간격을 봅니다. 그 갭 분석이라고 하는데, 그 갭 분석을 필래요. 그 다음에 프린켓을 찾고요. 프린켓을 조금 이따 말씀 드릴게요. 프린켓을 찾고, 그 다음에 클리니컬 프로토콜을
    
    그래서 아까 정수향이 핏볼 파이너로 여러가지 케이스를 말했는데 그것들을 미리 다 불러다녀요. 그래서 그게 인클루션 크라이토리하고 익스클루션 크라이토리를 미리 만들어 놓은거에요. 그게 이제 중요합니다. 미리미리 한다는게 아주 중요하죠. 왜냐면 FK 스터디가 시작이 되면 페이크 하면 절대 안됩니다. 절대 안돼요. 차라리 리트랙을 하는게 낫지. 헤드라면 굉장히 타격이 있어. 특히 싸덕같은 경우에는 부족했죠.
    
    그리고 필살은 뭐 하여튼 여기랑은 빨리 커뮤니케이션 하는게 최고다 하지만 이렇게 랜덤 질문을 던지면 절대 안되고 가이드 라인에 따라서 잘해야 됩니다. 그리고 이런것들은 당연히 준비가 되어야 되구요. 사실 이 얘기를 좀 많이 드리고 싶은데, 피해야 할 몇 가지의 미스테리가 있습니다.
    
    처음에 디바이스를 만들때 오전에 최우종 교수님이 말씀하셨지만 캔서 다이버나스틱을 홈케어로 한다고
    
    기술은 되겠죠. 기술은 됩니다. 하지만 풀비켓이 일단 없고 패트웨이가 잡히지 않아요. 패트웨이가 없으면 갈 수가 없죠. 당연히. 길이 없는데. 그래서 길을 막 누려야 돼요. 길을 만드는 길도 여러 가지가 있지만 남들이 가지 않는 길을 굳이 가려고 하는 건 상당히 힘들죠.
    
    그 디자인할 그 디바이스를 디자인할거다 이럴때 많이 생각나요 그렇게 해서 풀캡이 반드시 있어야됩니다. 그 아까도 말씀드렸지만
    
    그 멀티플 컴플렉터나 멀티플 프레디켓이 한국은 된다고 해요. 근데 미국은 좀 어렵습니다. 멀티플하게 차라리 내 제품을 남거나 그래서 남았다든지 그렇게 하는. 그리고 서븐션 데이터가 디자인 컨트롤러를 따르지 않는 경우가 많아요. 저도 그런 경우가 많은데, 갭 분석을 할 때 가져온 아날로그 크래스티안 게이밍이 되게 좋았어요. 되게 좋아서 5월 중도는 충분합니다. 하고, 뭐 필요할 것도...
    
    그래서 그걸 빨리 만들고 해서 지나가는데 결국 FDA가 뭘 요구했냐면 그 Model Comparison, Method Comparison 데이터가 그것의 원 소스, 그러니까 로데이터를 달라고 하는거죠. 결국에는 그 메소드 컴퓨터를 하는 그 샘플의 트랙서빌리티가 없었어요. 왜냐? 그 데이터가 한국에서 없었어요. 한국에서 굉장히 좋은 병원에서 한거에요 하지만 그 데이터가 없었어요 이게 있는데 낼 수 없을 정도였어요. 내기가 좀 힘든...
    
    그렇게 했으니까 그리고 스터디를 시작할때 레이스의 레프리센티브한 걸 골라야 되기 때문에 이게 실제적으로 쉽지가 않아요. 없다고는 말할 수는 없지만 그리고 우리같은 경우에는 휴머백터스터리나 이런 것들도 그래서 이렇게 피드백을 프로액티블리 준비를 하는게 되게 중요합니다. 처음부터. 그 다음에 다큐멘트도 시스템에 들어가게. 모든 다큐멘트가 정말 너무 중요합니다. 그래서 아까 그 디자인 컨트롤을 다 따라야 된다는 걸 말씀드리고요. 가장 그 석세스...
    
    그거에 요구조건이 첫번째가 Early Stage Planning 이거는 아예 뒤에서부터 생각하는게 좋죠. Commercialization을 위해서는 어떤 Inverse를 하고 그러면 어떤 넌 해석을 할거냐?
    
    미리 생각하면서 매 제품을 다루고 나가는게 베스트입니다.
    
    FD 에어플로그의 반은 아니지만 굉장히 크다. 이것만 준비를 잘하면 그 다음의 리버스건, 컨실러에이저션도 아주 쉽게 갈 수 있다. FDI 커뮤니케이션, 디스플레이션 찾는 것도 FDI가 나올 때 찾는 게 아니라 훨씬 전부 다 찾는 겁니다. 그리고 리인보스 마찬가지로. 그런 것들을 자유나 시간도 잃어버리지 않고요. 그 다음에 메스터 펀딩라운드에서도 잘 괜찮을 수가 있습니다. 승부작이 이어질 수가 있죠. 그래서 마켓하고 가는거다.
    
    펜을 일직하고, 엑스퍼트를 사용해야하고, 커뮤니케이션 프로액티브를 해야합니다. 물론 다 기록은 되지만, 그리고 데이터를 아주 중요시해야합니다. 그래서 at least in the deep, systematical 이라는게 처음에 로드맵을 잡는게 아주 중요하다. 그 말씀을 강조드립니다.
    
    아 이게 이제 최근에 업데이트인데 여기 있다 그리고
    
    그 큰 유세먼트는 LED였죠. 그 다음에 지금은 Cybersky LED라고 SAMD 완전히 있습니다.
    
    타뉴델스는 저희는 인사를 주로 하는데요. 저희는 인어 임상을 할 때 필요한 소프트웨어가 따로 있습니다. 그게 일렉트로닉 데이터 캡슐입니다.
    
    일렉트로닉 데이터 캡처 소프트웨어가 있습니다. 데이터를 보면 데이터도 많이 다릅니다. 비즈니스도 하고 제일 중요한 것은 얼바이트리 서비스에서 한국에서 혹은 다른 나라에서 미국으로 그거 있잖아요, 이제 셔누의 그...
    
    할 때 혹은 회사를 일수대로 유지할 때 저는 읽었고, 그리고 마케팅.
    
    그 다음에 레인보우스하고 이런 것들 계속 설명해 주시면 아주 좋은 활약을 가져갈 수 있을 것 같습니다. 감사합니다.
    
    저희가 시간을 한 10분정도 땡겼었는데요. 국장님께서 곡을 쓰셔서 체감이 다시 정신이 왔습니다. 오늘 지금 사실 FDA가 워낙 중요한 분들이 많다보니까

Sung Park (Reed Smith) "Appropriate Risk Allocation in the FDA World"
    
    Summary
    
    ### 소개 및 배경
    
    - Reed Smith LLP의 박성원 변호사는 FDA법 전문가로서 자신을 "플러머(문제 수리)"와 "페인터(투자자에게 FDA 리스크 설명)"로 비유
    - 한국 회사들이 FDA 규정 등에 의견을 제시할 수 있는 협회 설립을 환영
    - 미국 FDA 규제 환경에서 한국 기업들의 디지털헬스 진출 전략 논의
    
    ### 디지털헬스 시장 개요
    
    - 디지털헬스는 주요 디지털 기술을 이용해 건강/임상 결과를 향상시키는 기술
    - 현재 FDA에서 허가 받은 AI 의료기기는 약 1,250개, 그 중 75%(956개)가 방사선과 관련
    - 한국 기업들이 디지털헬스 분야에서 경쟁력을 갖출 수 있는 이유:
        - 다른 분야보다 규제 전략이 상대적으로 적음
        - 한국의 디지털 인재 풍부
    - 2024년 투자 시장이 성장 중:
        - 현재까지 9.9억 달러 투자
        - 평균 투자 규모가 20.4백만에서 28.1백만으로 증가
        - 19개 회사가 1억 달러 이상의 메가라운드 투자 유치
    
    ### FDA 규제 도전과제
    
    - 1976년 제정된 FDA 의료기기 법령이 디지털헬스에 완전히 적용되지 않음
    - FDA가 새로운 규제나 기존 규제를 매우 공격적으로 해석하는 경향
    - 규제가 혁신을 저해하는 동시에 FDA는 상당한 리소스를 규제 집행에 사용
    
    ### 사례 연구
    
    - **WHOOP 사례**:
        - 웨어러블 기기에서 혈압 데이터를 표시하는 것만으로도 의료기기로 분류
        - FDA는 혈압 측정 자체가 "inherently diagnostic" 행위라고 주장
        - 회사 CEO가 공개적으로 FDA와 맞서겠다고 발표
        - "나쁜 사실은 나쁜 선례를 만든다" - FDA와 싸우기에 좋은 사례가 아님
    - **임상 의사결정 지원(CDS) 소프트웨어 사례**:
        - CDS는 의료기기 효능 표기를 하면서도 의료기기 규제를 받지 않을 수 있는 카테고리
        - 의료기기 면제를 위한 4가지 기준 존재:
            1. 의료 이미지나 시그널을 직접 분석하지 않음
            2. 의료 정보 디스플레이
            3. 의료진에게 결정이 아닌 추천만 제공
            4. 의료진이 독립적으로 검토할 수 있는 근거 제공 
        - FDA는 추가 제한 조건 적용:
            - 자동화 기능 금지
            - 급박한 상황에서 사용되는 소프트웨어는 의료기기로 분류
        - 2023년 9월, FDA가 중환자 모니터링 제품에 경고장 발송
        - 대형 회사의 자회사에도 경고장을 보내는 등 적극적 규제 집행
    
    ### 전략적 고려사항
    
    - 제품 개발 시 리스크 감수는 불가피하지만, 절대 건드리면 안 되는 규제 영역 파악 필요
    - FDA 규제를 받을 필요가 있는지 고려하고, 가능하다면 제품 기능을 조정해 규제를 피하는 전략
    - 투자자들은 일반적으로 규제를 받지 않는 제품을 선호
    - 질병 진단 제품(투자의 29%)보다 환자 참여, 수익 주기 관리 등의 영역이 투자 유치에 유리
    - 연방 규제뿐 아니라 주 정부 규제도 모니터링 필요
    - 한국 회사들의 제품이 우수함에도 미국 시장 노출 부족 - 컨퍼런스 참가 등 홍보 필요
    
    ### 액션 아이템
    
    - [ ]  디지털헬스 제품 개발 시 주요 규제 "지뢰밭"을 파악하고 회피 전략 수립
    - [ ]  FDA 규제를 받을지 여부에 따라 제품 기능 설계 전략 검토
    - [ ]  연방 및 주 정부 차원의 데이터 프라이버시 규제 모니터링
    - [ ]  한국 기업들은 미국 컨퍼런스 참가 등을 통해 제품 홍보 기회 확대

    먼저 이 협회 만드신 거 축하드리고요. 제가 다른 때도 얘기했을 때 항상 한국 회사들에게 목소리가 필요하다고 생각하고 있었는데 이렇게 만들어져서 다행입니다. 예를 들어서 FDA같은 새로운 규정이나 법안이 나왔을 때는 미국 협회나 회사들이 커멘트를 통해서 Federal Registry를 선미신을 한 경우가 많은데 그런 걸 보면서 항상 한국 회사들도... 또 이게 있으면 베네피셜하겠다고 생각했는데 이번에 그런 기관이 생긴 것 같습니다. 저는 박성원이라고 하고요. 그 다음 리드 스미스의 FDA법 관련 변호사입니다. 
    
    ![page_001_6. KAMDA_Sung Park, Reed Smith LLP.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_001_6._KAMDA_Sung_Park_Reed_Smith_LLP.jpg)
    
    저는 제가 하는 일을 플러머 또는 페인터라고 하는데 플러머는 문제 생겼을 때 FDA 관련 일을 고치기 때문에 플러머고요. 페인터 같은 경우는 투자자들에게 FDA 관련 리스크에 대해서 설명을 하기 때문에
    
    ![page_002_6. KAMDA_Sung Park, Reed Smith LLP.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_002_6._KAMDA_Sung_Park_Reed_Smith_LLP.jpg)
    
    오늘 나눈 내용들이 변호사 클라이언트 릴레이싱이나 이걸 말씀드리라고 저는 회사에서 계속 교육받고 있습니다. 
    
    오늘 논의할 내용은 첫 번째로는 지금 디지털 엑스 시장에서 얼마나 많은 혁신감이 일어나고 있는지, 투자 시장도 얼마나 커지고 있는지 그에 관해서 규제가 어떻게 발목을 잡고 있는지에 관한 거고요. 플레인필드로 봤을 때, 물론 아까 말씀드린 것처럼 커멘트를 선미션하는 그런 액티비티를 통해서 플레인필드를 바꾸려고 하실 수 있겠지만 바뀌지 않는 과정에서 이런 플레인필드는 우리에게 주어진 건데 이걸 어떻게 활용해서 성공을 시킬 수 있을지에 관한 내용입니다.
    
    디지털스, 단어 디지털스를 봤을 때 여기에 법적 데피니션은 없지만 주요 디지털 기술을 이용해서 건강이나 임상 결과를 향상시키는 것이라고 보면 될 것 같습니다. 이 데피니션이 굉장히 브라더죠. 그런데 일반적으로 우리가 사용하는 디지털헬스 단어의 의미는 아까 말씀하신 대로 SAMT 그러니까 예를 들어서 AI를 사용한 소프트웨어 정도가 될 수 있겠죠. 그리고 사실 요즘 그런 기능들은 워낙 거의 모든 의료기기에 많아져서 디지털헬스 의료기기라고 하지 않을 수 있는 의료기기가 오히려 적을 정도입니다. FDA에서 지금 현재까지 허가를 받은 정확히 말하면 510 Difference를 받은 G-SERVICE AI 의료기기가 1250개 정도 되고요. 그 다음에 그 중 거의 정확하게 75%인 956개 정도가 Radiology Philately에서 허가를 받은
    
    그리고 이 중에서는 사실 한국 회사들도 굉장히 많습니다. 그래서 제가 생각하기에는 한국 회사들이 상당한 이점을 가지고 경쟁력을 가질 수 있는 분야가 디지털스 라고 생각하는데 그 이유는 첫 번째로는 방금 말씀하신 법적 또는 regulatory 규제 전략이 다른 필드에 비해서는 좀 더 적은 편이구요. 두번째로는 한국에 워낙 재능이 있으신 분들도 이쪽으로 많아서 디지털 사업이 앞으로도 크지 않을까 개인적으로 생각하고 있고 또 지난 몇년만 제가 경험해 왔던 부분입니다. 투자 시장 같은 경우는 2024년에 비해서 투자가 그래도 많이 늘어난 편인데요. 지금 3월 3일에 끝났을 때 9.9밀레닌 달러
    
    Average deal size도 작년에 20.4밀리언에서 28.1밀리언정도 올랐고, 여기서 한가지는 이 숫자의 상당부분이 메가라운드라고 불리는 상당히 큰 트랜섹션의 회사가 많습니다. 19개정도의 회사들이 100밀리언정도, 또는 더 큰 메가라운드라고 불립니다. 그 다음에 이거는 앞으로 있을 AURA, 거의 900백만원 될거라고 하는데, AURA를 쓰신 분 있나요? 그 펀딩은 아직 카운트하지 않은 그런 숫자입니다. M&A 액티비티도 늘어나서 작년 120개 정도에서 지금 165개를 넘었다고 합니다.
    
    그렇게 시장이 커지고 있고 혁신도 많아지고 있는 FDA 규제 허가를 받는 반면에서 발목을 잡고 있는 부분은 제 생각에는 FDA 규제 부분입니다. FDA 의료기관련 법령은 1976년에 먼저 만들어졌고 그래서 일단은 상당히 의회에서도 그렇고 FDA 부부도 그렇고 뭐 스태츄들과 가이든스들 통해서 많은 변화를 아직 상당부분이 디지털스에는 조명이 되지 않습니다. 두번째, 이거보다 더 제가 항상 아쉬운 부분은 뭐냐면 FDA에서 계속 이 새로운 범죄들이나 기존 범죄들을 굉장히 aggressive하게 해석을 합니다. 그리고 그 aggressive한 해석을 지키기 위해서 굉장히 많은 리소스를 저는 낭비하고 있습니다.
    
    생각합니다. 이거에 대해서 두가지 예시를 생각해 볼거구요. 그래서 제가 이 얘기를 하는건 무엇이냐면, 그 리소스가 낭비가 되고 있던 아니면 어떤 업그레이드가 될 수 있던 간에 저희가 할 일은 그 나중에 보시겠지만 지뢰찾기처럼 가지 않을 때를 알면 되는거거든요. 거기는 피해가면서 가장 시장에 빨리 커머셜라이즈 할 수 있도록 제가 플래닛 분들과 항상 논의하는 부분이 이런 점입니다. 아까 케이스 두개를 논의하겠다고 했는데 혹시 
    
    ![page_003_6. KAMDA_Sung Park, Reed Smith LLP.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_003_6._KAMDA_Sung_Park_Reed_Smith_LLP.jpg)
    
    여기 WOOP!라는 제품 쓰신 분 있으신가요? 아니, 보신 분? 아, 쓰신 분이요? 네, 혹시 모르시는 분들은...
    
    이 제품인데요. 오른쪽에 팔목에 차고 있는 제품이 있죠. 그리고 여기 그래픽 한번 봐주세요. 118, 78. 그 다음에 초록색, 노란색, 주황색 있죠. 여기 초록색, 노란색, 주황색도 예전에 비해서 바쁜데, 이게 왜 중요한지 조금 이따가 말씀드릴게요. 제가 지금 얘기할 부분은 General Wellness라는 것에 관한 컨셉, General Wellness라는 regulatory pathway에요. 기업이 크지 않은 일반적인 헬티한 라이프스타일을 메인테인하거나 인코리즈하는 소프트웨어 제품에 대해서는 FDA가 의료기기로 규제하지 않는다. 규제하지 않을 뿐만 아니라 법적으로 의회가 규제를 못하게 해놨어요.
    
    정확한 법적 내비주의입니다. 그렇게 해놨고, 근데 아까 제가 말씀드렸던 것처럼 FDA에서 이런 부분에 대해서 굉장히 엄격하게 이 법안을 해석을 하고 있습니다.
    
    FTA에 사는 말은, 지금 여기 우흡기기 있죠? 우흡기기 5월달에 새로 나오는 Blood Pressure Insight 혈압, 혈압 인사이트, 혈압 뭐 인사이트면 아, 하여튼 혈압에 대해서 숫자를 표시해주는 이 행위 자체가 이 기기를 의료기기로 바꾼다 이 말입니다. 그리고 Movi, FD 클리어링스가 없었기 때문에 이 유력이기는 불법 유력이기다. 
    
    이렇게 했는데, 굉장히 좀 인트로스팅 한거는 사실 우리가 여기 온도계 있잖아요. 
    
    일반적으로 쉽게 사용할 수 있는 온도계.
    
    일반적인, 또는 Heart Rate Monitor, 또는 Oxygen Saturation Monitor, 이런 경우는 의료기기로 사용하는 경우도 있고, 아니면 의료기기가 아닌 경우를 사용하는 경우도 있어요. 예를들어서 제가 자전거 잘 타는데, 자전거 탈 때 허브레이트 모니터링 하는건 의료기기 용도는 아니겠죠? 그 다음에 SPO2도 FDA도 인정합니다. 의료기기로 사용하는 경우가 있고, 의료기기로 사용하지 않는 경우가 있다고. 실제 프로토콜을 두 개 다르게 만들어놨어요. FDA가 여기서 얘기하는거는...
    
    화면이 잘못들어왔네요. FDA가 여기서 얘기하는 것은 블롯 프레셔를 나타내기 때문에 블롯 프레셔를 나타내기 때문에 어, 인헤를리 그 자체가 의료기기로 구분이 될 수밖에, 규제가 될 수밖에 없다. 이거예요. 예를 들어서 제가 온도계가 있어요. 온도계가 있는데 온도를 나타내기 때문에 그 자체가 의료기이다. 질병을 진단하는 행위다. 또는 헐페이 모니터가 있어요. 근데 제가 뭐 뛰기도 하고 자전거도 타는데 그때 헐페를 재기 위해서 사용한 건데 그 행위 자체가 의료진단 행위다. 이렇게 판단한 거예요. 실제로 그 뭐랬는지 보면 inherently means diagnosis 라는 단어들이 나옵니다.
    
    법적으로 봤을때 굉장히 굉장히 어그레시브한 해석이구요. 근데 제가 놀랐던거는 이 회사에 대해서 더 놀랐습니다. 이 회사가 5월달에 제품 출시하고 7월달 FDA부터 원인을 받았어요. 굉장히 빨리 받은거거든요. 받자마자 CNN의 Will Ahmed가 LinkedIn에 스테이크링을 통해 말했습니다. 그러면서 우리는 FDA에 대해 정보를 전달했습니다. 우리는 FDA의 앱에서 미모를 계산하지 않을 것입니다. 주로 FDA하고 싸울 때는 조용히 싸우는데 CEO가 홈페이지와 개인 링딩에 우리는 FDA 계속 싸우겠다 이렇게 표기를 한겁니다. 그러고서는 제가 이게 오늘 사진인데 아직도 안 내렸어요. 계속 싸우겠다 이거죠. 근데 한가지 바뀐 점은 예전에 보면은 여기가 초록색 주황색이었나 빨간색 이렇게 돼 있었는데 지금 색을 살짝 바꿨더라구요.
    
    그래서 아직 뭔가 배크럼 디스커싱이 있지 않나 그런 생각을 하겠습니다. 이거는 제 법적 생각은 그렇다고 하지만 하지만 그렇다고 해서 제 생각에는 아마 5B 싸우기에 굉장히 힘든 싸움이 될 것 같습니다. 왜냐면 아직까지 작년에 어떤 케이스가 있었는데 그게 이제... 정보기관들의 결정을 내릴 수 있는 권한을 약화시키는 그런 결정이 있었는데 그런 결정이 있다고 해도 법원들은 이런 의료나 테크니컬 판단에 대해서는 FDA에 손을 들어줄 확률이 굉장히 높고요. 그래서 FDA가 이 숫자 자체가 inherently diagnostic하다 하면 그걸 손을 들어줄 확률이 높고 그 다음에 그 전에 MOB이 사용했던 그런 클레인들
    
    이게 확률이 좀 더 크다고 생각하고, 제가 아쉽게 생각하는 건 bad facts make for bad precedents 라는 단어가 있는거죠. 그러니까 나쁜 사실이 있으면 나쁜 예시가 생긴 거거든요. 그래서 이 예시가 사실 FDA를 싸우기에는, FDA의 푸시팩 하기에는 가장 좋은 예시는 아니었지 않나 라는 생각을 합니다. 어쨌든 지금 이런 리스크, 제품 개발하는 분들, 스피킹 채널의 웨딩스 제품을 개발해주시는 분들이 있다면 이런 리스크가 있고.
    
    ![page_004_6. KAMDA_Sung Park, Reed Smith LLP.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_004_6._KAMDA_Sung_Park_Reed_Smith_LLP.jpg)
    
    두 번째는 어떻게 보면 디지털 스코어에 대해서 좀 클래식한 이슈인데, 요즘은 줄어들었습니다만 클리니컬 디지털 스코어 소프트웨어라는 카테고가 있습니다. 그런데 제조사들이 노력을 굉장히 많이 했었어요. 왜 쓰냐? 의료기기의 어떤 80% 수준의 효능표기를 할 수 있으면서도 의료기기의 규제를 받지 않았어요. 그러니까 시장을 엄청 빠르게 시작하면 제품을 내놓을 수 있는 거예요. 근데 이것도 마찬가지로 당연히 법안에 의해서 왼쪽에 있는 제품 같은 경우는 4개의 크라이티널을 Satisfy하면 의료기기로 규정하지 않는다라는 걸 법안에서 확인을 받았는데 FDA가 엄청나게 또 엄격한 잣대를 드립니다.

    그 4가지를 간단하게 확인해보면, 이 4가지를 총적시키면 의료기기가 아닌거에요. 이게 뭐냐면, 첫번째로는 메디컬 이미지나 시그널, 예를 들어서 ECG같은 시그널을 직접적으로 분석하지 않고 두번째로는 메디클 인포메이션 디스플레이예요. 두번째는 좀 의미가 적은 그런 크라이텍입니다. 세번째로는, 아 이게 중요한건데, 의료진에게 반드시 결정을 내리지 않고, 결정을 전달하지는 않고, 추천만 전달해야 돼요. 추천만. 네번째로는 그 추천에 대해서 의료진이 독립적으로 리뷰를 할 수 있도록 베이스리스트를 제공해야 합니다. FDA가 여기서 한게 뭐냐면, 이 세번째 크라이티어에 대해서, 하이라이트 된 부분 보이시죠? 세번째 크라이티어에 대해서 FDA 자체의 기준을 또 집어넣습니다. 또 집어넣는데 그게 뭐냐면
    
    추천을 하면은 추천을 하면 추천만 하면 여기가 아니긴 한데 단지 세가지 조건이 있어요. 첫번째 그 소프트웨어의 오토메이션이 있으면 안돼요. 자동화가 있으면 안돼요. 왜 FDA가 그렇게 얘기하느냐 하면 어떤 자동화라는 과정이 있으면 의료진이라고 해도 automation bias라는 것 때문에 자동화 편향이라고 하던데 그것 때문에 검증 없이 자동화된 결과를 믿을 확률이 높다는 거예요 FDA에 따라서는. 실제로 어떤 스터디도 있는 것 같고요. 예를 들어서 저희가 70PT나 이런 걸 쓰면서 자전거 운전해서 나온 결과에는 컴퓨터가 되는 주요건을 믿게 된다, 이건 이런 거고 두 번째로는 급박한 상황, 급박한 상황에서 사용되어 있는 소프트웨어는 의료기기로 분류가 된다.
    
    이걸 FDA가 한거고, 근데 다시 말씀드리지만 법령에는 어디에도 급박한 상황에 대한 리미테이션이나 방금 말씀드린 오토메이션에 대한 리미테이션이 없어요. 그래서 어떻게 이런걸 발표를 해서 2022년인가 발표를 해서 한번 난리가 났었습니다. 왜냐면 CDS 제품들이 굉장히 많았거든요 시장에.
    
    그래서 과연 FDA가 이거를 집행할 것인가, 그리고 집행하면 소송하기 위해서 또 거기도 협회가 만들어졌습니다. 한 1년동안 두고보다가 FDA가 2023년 9월에 드디어 경고점을 보냅니다. 이건 퍼블릭 여별로 보는 정보고 회사이름은 여기 안 적었지만 찾아보시면 나오구요. 면추킬러스포트, 크리티컬 케어에 있는 환자들에게 면추킬러스포트를 제공하는 제품에 대한 경고장인데 거기서 특히 FDA가 문제를 삼은 부분이 patient-specific medical information, time-critical setting에서 알람을 제공하기 때문에 불법적인 제품이다. 그리고 이 회사 제품이, 경고장 받은 회사가
    
    엄청 큰 회사의 자회사 거든요 그런 회사한테도 FT가 두려워하지 않고 어 이거 한번 해보자 이러면서 경고장을 보낸거에요
    
    그래서 지금 결론적으로 그 협회가 FDA한테 소송을 하진 않았지만 지금 이 CBS 제품 카테고리에서도 굉장히 FDA가 규제를 가할 확률이 높은 상황입니다. 그리고 처음에 트럼프 대통령이 들어왔을 때, 그리고 FD 천안이 바뀌었을 때 되게 많은 사람들 접하면서 아 이거 규제가 얕아질 거다. 그래서 만약 시장이 진입한다면 지금이 진입하기 좋을 때라고 했는데 특히 디지털스 분야의 규제를 보면 전혀 그렇지 않고요. 오히려 이런 케이스들이 공식적으로나 비공식적으로 규제를 받는 경우들이 늘어나고 있습니다.
    
    ![page_006_6. KAMDA_Sung Park, Reed Smith LLP.jpg](Session%20I%20Strategies%20and%20FDA%20Considerations%20for%20U%20/page_006_6._KAMDA_Sung_Park_Reed_Smith_LLP.jpg)
    
    그래서 이걸 봤을 때 생각해야 되는게 무엇일까? 라고 보면 일단 두가지, 제품 개발, 그 다음에 커머셜라이제이션 또는 인베스멘트 스테이지에서 생각할 수 있는게 있을 것 같아요. 아까 지뢰찾기를 제가 잠깐 말씀드렸는데 제품을 특히 디지털스 분야에서 제품 개발할 때는 어느정도의 어쩔 수 없이 리스크를 테이크해야 되는 건 맞습니다. 일단 첫번째로 규제 자체가 불명확한 것도 있구요. 그 다음에 조금 더 남들보다 억를 습하게 나가야지 시장 점유율을 얻는 경우도 있습니다.
    
    그게 있는데, 정말 중요한 애리아, 진짜 건드려서는 안되는 것이 뭔지 알아야 돼요. 건드려서 안되는 것이 뭔지 알아야 되고, 아까 말씀드린 것처럼 FDA는 그렇게 큰 회사들도 심지어 테이크아웃 하는 것을 두려워하지 않기 때문에, 어떤 걸 FDA가 정말 중요하고, 어떤 걸 중요하지 않는지를 잘 판단하셔야 됩니다. 그리고 제가 한 가지 더 생각할 부분은 만약에 가능하다면, 과연 내가 정말 FDA의 규제를 받을 필요가 있을까? 조그만 프로듀스 펑셀러니티를 바꿔서 규제 안 받는 쪽으로 나아가는 것도 괜찮지 않을까?
    
    다른 것도 생각해볼 만한 가치가 있다고 생각해요. 예를 들어서 어제 제가 컨퍼런스에서 돌아왔는데 거기서 투자자들이 몇 분하고 하면서 얘기했던 논의 중에 하나가 물론 제품 사이즈, 파운더, 시장 사이즈 이런 것들은 다 다르겠지만 일반적으로 헬스케어 분야에서 규제를 받는 제품을 원하는지 아니면 규제를 받지 않는 제품을 원하는지에 대해서 얘기했을 때 대부분의 경우는 규제 받지 않는 것을 더 선호한다고 봐요. 당연하죠. 그리고 그 경우도 제품이 더 빠르게 퍼 나갈 수도 있고요. 그렇지만 아까 말씀하신 것처럼 규제를 있는 경우는 오히려
    
    방어선 처럼 작용할 수 있으니까 어떤게 더 회사의 성장에 도움이 되는지는 판단하셔야 할 문제라고 생각하는데 단지 생각할거면 꼭 FD 휴지를 받는 제품을 만들 필요가 있다. 두 번째, 방금 말씀드린 것처럼 실제로 아까 받은 투자의 금액에 대해서 투자를 브레이크 하는 걸 보니까 실제로 질병을 증가하는 제품 같은 경우는 전체 투자의 한 29%에 비해서 헬스케어 환경에서 이루어지는 다른 많은 행위들, 예를 들어서 페이션 엔게이지먼트 아니면 빌딩 레비뉴 사이클 매니지먼트 아니면 빌딩 서포트 위버스만한 데는 좀 더 쉽게 만들어지는 이런 제품들, 아니면 뭐 AI 체포 이런 경우들은 오히려 더 투자를 쉽게 받는다는 그런 해석을 할 수 있는 숫자들도 있었고, 그리고 실제로 저희가 어제 방금 말씀드린 것처럼 만나던 숫자들도 비슷한 얘기를 했습니다.
    
    디지털스의 경우, 특히 AI관련 아니면 데이터 관련해서는 Federal 보관들 뿐만 아니라 주거 보관들도 너무 많아요. 그래서 얼마전에는 예를 들어서 일리노이주에서 멘탈스 관련해서 Checkbox을 사용할 수 없게 하는 그런 보관도 나오고. 지금 아홉개인가 주에서 데이터 프라이비시 관련해서 여기서 만약 디지털에서 데이터를 다루는 회사들이 있으시다면 따로따로 규제하는 그런 법안도 계속 나오고 있고요. 그래서 이런 것들을 계속 모니터링 하셔야지 아까 말씀드린 것처럼 정말 큰 리스크의 엘리애를 피해갈 수 있는 그런 제품을 개발할 수 있지 않나 생각합니다.

    마지막으로 생각했던 것은 제가 어제 보면서 가끔가다 이렇게 미국 회사들, 미국 투자회사들의 포트폴리오를 보면은 한국에도 제가 만난 회사 중에서도 되게 소피스틱해 있다고 그리고 제품들이 좋은 회사들도 많은데 꼭 미국 회사들이라고 해서 투자를 더 잘 받고 일해야 되는 건 아닌데 라는 생각이 들 때가 가끔 있습니다. 그래서 컨퍼런스라든지 어떤 이렇게 또 이런 데 많이 나가셔서 제품을 많이 홍보하시면 더 넓은 그런 기회와 더 많은 시장이 열리지 않을까 그렇게 생각합니다.
    
    20분간 체험을 하였습니다. 감사합니다.
    
    첫 번째 섹션을 마치도록 하겠고요.
